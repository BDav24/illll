## Positioning

### Tagline Options

- "Six habits. One longer life."
- "Evidence-based longevity, beautifully simple."
- "Live longer. Track what matters."

### Core Differentiators

1. **Science-backed** — every habit grounded in peer-reviewed research
2. **Privacy-first** — zero tracking, zero analytics, all data stays on device
3. **Minimal & beautiful** — no bloat, no social features, no gamification traps
4. **Offline-first** — works anywhere, no account required
5. **Global from day one** — 20+ languages supported out of the box

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | ILLLL Advantage |
|---|---|
| Generic habit trackers (Habitica, Streaks) | Curated to longevity science, not arbitrary habits |
| Health platforms (MyFitnessPal, Apple Health) | Focused and simple vs. complex and overwhelming |
| Biohacking apps (Oura, Whoop) | Free, no hardware required, no subscription |
| Journaling apps (Day One, Daylio) | Action-oriented daily habits, not reflective journaling |

## Channels

### Tier 1 — High Impact, Low Cost

| Channel | Strategy |
|---|---|
| **Reddit** | Post in r/longevity, r/biohackers, r/selfimprovement, r/productivity. Lead with value: "The 6 habits with the strongest evidence for extending lifespan." Let the app be the answer, not the pitch. |
| **Twitter/X** | Target the longevity and health-tech community. Use thread format: research-backed insights with the app as a natural CTA. Engage with Huberman/Attia/Johnson communities. |
| **Product Hunt** | Launch with a strong narrative around privacy + simplicity. Aim for Tuesday–Thursday. Prepare assets, a compelling tagline, and rally early users for launch day. |
| **Hacker News** | "Show HN" post emphasizing the tech stack (Expo, offline-first, MMKV, no backend) and the privacy-first stance. This community rewards transparency and craft. |

### Tier 2 — Medium Effort, Strong Returns

| Channel | Strategy |
|---|---|
| **App Store Optimization (ASO)** | Target keywords: longevity habits, health tracker, daily habits, lifespan, evidence-based health, habit tracker privacy. Optimize screenshots and description for conversion. |
| **YouTube & Podcasts** | Pitch mid-tier health and longevity creators for reviews and features. Provide early access and a clear story angle. Avoid cold-pitching top-tier creators initially. |
| **Newsletters** | Pitch curated lists: Dense Discovery, Longevity Insider, Wellness Wisdom, The Hustle, TLDR. Short pitch focused on the privacy angle or the science angle depending on the audience. |
| **SEO / Content Marketing** | Publish 1–2 articles per month on topics like "The Most Evidence-Based Longevity Habits" or "Why Your Habit Tracker Doesn't Need an Account." Link naturally to the app. |

### Tier 3 — Low Effort, Organic Growth

| Channel | Strategy |
|---|---|
| **Indie Hackers** | Build-in-public story: share revenue (or lack thereof), design decisions, and technical choices. This community supports privacy-focused indie apps. |
| **Instagram / TikTok** | Short-form content: "One habit that adds X years to your life" with quick app demos. Repurpose across platforms. |
| **AlternativeTo / Slant** | List as an alternative to Streaks, Habitica, and other habit trackers. Highlight the longevity focus and privacy stance. |
| **Word of Mouth** | The multi-language support and offline-first design make it naturally shareable in markets where other apps fall short. |
