THE 6 HABITS

🫁 BREATHING
5 minutes of structured breathing drops cortisol, raises HRV, and outperforms meditation for anxiety reduction. Stanford research, 2023.

10-30 minutes of sunlight sets your circadian clock, boosts serotonin, and is as effective as antidepressants for mood. JAMA Psychiatry, 2016.

🥗 HEALTHY FOOD
A balanced plate cuts depression risk 33% and cardiovascular disease 30%. The SMILES trial proved diet changes alone can reverse depression.

Your brain clears toxic waste during deep sleep. Less than 7 hours raises mortality 13%. One bad night cuts emotional regulation by 60%.
